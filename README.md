# React Native Todo App

This is a simple Todo App built using React Native. The app allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. The tasks can be categorized into three statuses: "Todo", "In Progress", and "Done". The app provides separate screens for managing tasks based on their status.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Users can add new tasks with a title and status.
- **Update Todos**: Existing tasks can be edited and their status can be changed.
- **Delete Todos**: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
- **Status Filtering**: Tasks are displayed on separate screens based on their status (Todo, In Progress, Done).
- **No Items Message**: When there are no tasks to display, a message is shown to inform the user.

## Screens

- **Todo Screen**: Displays tasks that are yet to be started.
- **Progress Screen**: Displays tasks that are currently in progress.
- **Done Screen**: Displays tasks that are completed.
